## Currency Converter

I am new to reactjs and to try out something i have created this app. I am new to **Web Development itself**.

This app basicaly fetches exchange rate from [https://www.exchangerate-api.com/](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)   and conversion is done Programatically. This app is good starting point for reactjs newbies.
